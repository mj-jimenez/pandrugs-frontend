<h3>What is PanDrugs?</h3>
      <p class="db_desc"><strong>PanDrugs</strong> provides a bioinformatics platform
<strong>to prioritize anticancer drug treatments according to individual genomic data</strong>.</p>

<p class="db_desc">Data input: standard VCF file, RNK file, gene lists and drug query.</p>
    <p class="db_desc">Please note the PanDrugs terminology for druggable genes:
      <ol type="I">
        <li><strong>Direct targets</strong>: Genes that contribute to disease phenotype and can be directly
        targeted by a drug (i.e. BRAF is a direct target for vemurafenib).</li>
        <li><strong>Biomarkers</strong>: Genes showing a genetic status associated with drug response
        which protein product is not the drug target itself (i.e. BRCA-mutated
        cancers responding to PARP inhibitors).</li>
        <li><strong>Pathway members</strong>: Genes located downstream in the biological pathway of a given undruggable gene.</li>
      </ol>

    <h3>PanDrugs workflow</h3>
    <p>PanDrugs considers drug indication and status, gene-drug associations
    and number of hits to calculate the <strong>Drug Score
    (DScore)</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Gene Score (GScore)</strong> is
    estimated according to gene essentiality and tumoral vulnerability, gene
    relevance in cancer, the biological impact of mutations, the frequency
    of gene alterations and their clinical implications.</p> <p>PanDrugs
    resolves the <em>Best Therapeutic Candidates</em> based on the accumulated and
    weighted scoring of <strong>GScore</strong> and <strong>DScore</strong>.</p>
