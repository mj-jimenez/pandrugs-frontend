      <h3>What is PanDrugs?</h3>

      <p class="db_desc"><strong>PanDrugs</strong> provides a platform <strong>to
        guide the selection of therapies from the results of genome-wide studies
        in cancer disease.</strong></p>
      <p class="db_desc">Using 4 alternative inputs (e.g. standard VCF files, RNK
        files, gene list and drug query), <strong>PanDrugs identify actionable
          molecular alterations and prioritize drugs by calculating gene-drug
          scores</strong> which takes into account: i) genomic feature evidence by
        mutation impact score; ii) target pathway context; iii) drug approval status
        (FDA, clinical trial or experimental small molecule inhibitors) and iv)
        manually-curated pharmacological information retrieved from the
        literature.</p>
      <p class="db_desc"><strong>PanDrugs scores combines biological and clinical
        relevance of the genes and their susceptibility to be targeted </strong>
        reflecting the strength or evidence level of the gene-drug association in order
        to assist the clinical decision making.</p>
      <p class="db_desc">PanDrugs current
        version integrates data from 18 primary sources and supports ~50,000 drug-target
        associations obtained from ~6,000 genes and ~11,000 unique compounds.</p>

    on punctual genetic alterations. Each bubble represents a druggable alteration
    and the gene score is the highest one among the computed for the altered gene in
    each patient. For each gene, the highest availability of the treatment is
    selected to establish the status label druggability of the gene (e.g. Approved
    in same tumor type is preferable before approved in other tumor types).

    This plot shows the percentage of patients in different tumor types from TCGA
    study that would be treated according to PanDrugs suggestions based on punctual
    genetic alterations. Each bubble represents a treatment with a particular drug
    and the drug score is the highest one among the computed for each patient that
    could be treated with that compound. Only alterations with a gene score greater
    or equal than 0.6 are considered.
