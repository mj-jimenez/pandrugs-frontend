  <h4>What is PanDrugs?</h4>

  <p class="db_desc"><strong>PanDrugs</strong> provides a platform <strong>to
  guide the selection of therapies from the results of genome-wide studies
  in cancer disease.</strong></p>
  <p class="db_desc">Using 4 alternative inputs (e.g. standard VCF files, RNK
  files, gene list and drug query), <strong>PanDrugs identify actionable
  molecular alterations and prioritize drugs by calculating gene-drug
  scores</strong> which takes into account: i) genomic feature evidence by
  mutation impact score; ii) target pathway context; iii) drug approval status
  (FDA, clinical trial or experimental small molecule inhibitors) and iv)
  manually-curated pharmacological information retrieved from the
  literature.</p>
  <p class="db_desc"><strong>PanDrugs scores combines biological and clinical
  relevance of the genes and their susceptibility to be targeted </strong>
  reflecting the strength or evidence level of the gene-drug association in order
  to assist the clinical decision making.</p> <p class="db_desc">PanDrugs current
  version integrates data from 18 primary sources and supports ~50,000 drug-target
  associations obtained from ~6,000 genes and ~11,000 unique compounds.</p>
