    <h3>What is PanDrugs?</h3>

    <p class="db_desc"><strong>PanDrugs</strong> provides a platform <strong>to
    guide the selection of therapies from the results of genome-wide studies
    in cancer disease.</strong></p>
    <p class="db_desc">Using 4 alternative inputs (e.g. standard VCF files, RNK
    files, gene list and drug query), <strong>PanDrugs identify actionable
    molecular alterations and prioritize drugs by calculating gene-drug
    scores</strong> which takes into account: i) genomic feature evidence by
    mutation impact score; ii) target pathway context; iii) drug approval status
    (FDA, clinical trial or experimental small molecule inhibitors) and iv)
    manually-curated pharmacological information retrieved from the
    literature.</p>
    <p class="db_desc"><strong>PanDrugs scores combines biological and clinical
    relevance of the genes and their susceptibility to be targeted </strong>
    reflecting the strength or evidence level of the gene-drug association in order
    to assist the clinical decision making.</p> <p class="db_desc">PanDrugs current
    version integrates data from 18 primary sources and supports ~50,000 drug-target
    associations obtained from ~6,000 genes and ~11,000 unique compounds.</p>

    This plot shows the percentage of patients in different tumor types from TCGA
    study with druggable alterations according to the suggestions by PanDrugs based
    on punctual genetic alterations. Each bubble represents a druggable alteration
    and the gene score is the highest one among the computed for the altered gene in
    each patient. For each gene, the highest availability of the treatment is
    selected to establish the status label druggability of the gene (e.g. Approved
    in same tumor type is preferable before approved in other tumor types).

  <p class="tcga_desc" ng-if="d3view == 'drugs'">
    This plot shows the percentage of patients in different tumor types from TCGA
    study that would be treated according to PanDrugs suggestions based on punctual
    genetic alterations. Each bubble represents a treatment with a particular drug
    and the drug score is the highest one among the computed for each patient that
    could be treated with that compound. Only alterations with a gene score greater
    or equal than 0.6 are considered.
